Convert my multiple-choice questions into JSON using the following convention:
{
    "set": [
        {
            "question": "{QUESTION}",
            "responses": [
                {
                    "text": "{A}",
                    "accept": {tf}
                },
                {
                    "text": "{B}",
                    "accept": {tf}
                },
                {
                    "text": "{C}",
                    "accept": {tf}
                },
                {
                    "text": "{D}",
                    "accept": {tf}
                }
            ]
        },
    ]
}
where {QUESTION} is replaced with the name of the question, {A} {B} {C} {D} are replaced with the answers to the question, and {tf} is a boolean that should be true if the answer is marked as correct with a greater than sign > in front of it and false if the greater than sign is not present. When placing the answers into JSON, remove the greater than sign.

Here are the questions:
